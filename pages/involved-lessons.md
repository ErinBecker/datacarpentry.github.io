## Suggest an improvement to an existing lesson

The Carpentries lessons are collaboratively developed - anyone can contribute and we receive contributions daily. 
All of our lessons are on GitHub and [creating an account][join-github] is required to contribute directly to the lessons. To fix a typo,
correct an 
error, clarify an example, or otherwise suggest an improvement to an existing lesson, you can file an issue on the lesson's GitHub 
repository. For typo fixes and error corrections, pull requests are also welcome! For suggestions, and to propose large-scale changes, 
please start a conversation through an issue rather than putting in a pull request. This gives the lesson Maintainers and the rest of the
community an opportunity to discuss the suggestion before you've done all of the work. If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can
also submit a comment or question through one of our [communication channels][comms].

For more details on the workflow of how to contribute via GitHub, see this community contributed [tutorial][git-tutorial].

## Suggest a new lesson or share lesson materials

Many of our community members are excited about developing lessons for other domains and technologies, or for more advanced topics than
we teach in our workshops. We provide [The Carpentries Incubator][incubator] as a place for community discussion about potential
new lessons, and for openly sharing Carpentries-style lessons. Any lesson that uses The Carpentries [lesson template][lesson-template], follows our [Code of Conduct][coc], and is licensed either [CC-BY][cc-by] or [CC-0][cc-0] can be hosted in The Carpentries Incubator. 
Open an [issue][issues] in the Incubator to start a discussion or to share your lesson. You can learn more about The Carpentries approach 
to curriculum development in our [Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh].

In the near future, we will also provide a friendly, community-supported, peer-review process for lessons. After the peer-review process, the lessons will be hosted in [The Carpentries Lab][carpentries-lab] and will be officially endorsed by The Carpentries as high-quality resources.
